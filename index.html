      Yet another new tab replacement extension for google chrome web browser. It adds an beautiful flip clock, combined with a check for unread google mail emails. Also includes different themes for the user to choose and quick access to the available chrome apps. I worked together with one awesome designer(<a href="https://github.com/mac-cypher">Mac Cypher</a>) on this project. He contributed the wonderful themes, logos and images for the chrome webstore.
